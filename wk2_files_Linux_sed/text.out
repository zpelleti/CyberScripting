In the late 1960s, Bell Labs was involved in a project with MIT and General Electric to develop a time-sharing system, called Multiplexed Information and Computing Service (Multics), 
allowing multiple users to access a mainframe simultaneously. Dissatisfied with the project's progress, 
Bell Labs management ultimately withdrew.
Ken Thompson, a programmer in the Labs' computing research department, had worked on Multics. 
He decided to write his own operating system. While he still had access to the Multics environment, 
he wrote simulations for the new file and paging system on it.
